    "# Binary Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)** attack is a form of attack that targets critical systems such as servers, websites or network resources by temporarily or permanently disrupting connection to the network host, causing a denial of service for users. A typical DDoS attack is accomplished by flooding the target with excess traffic to render the service offline. DDoS attacks are practically impossible to prevent and pose several information and business risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary Classification** is the task of classifying a dataset into two given groups. In Machine Learning, a binary classifier is a form of supervised learning, which means an input is mapped to an output based on example input-output pairs. For example, food would be an input and edible/inedible would be outputs. A binary classifier would attempt to predict edible or inedible food types by learning from examples of edible and inedible food. <br/>\n",
    "Some commonly used methods for binary classification include decision trees, random forests, bayesian networks, support vector machines, neural networks and logistic regression. Binary classifiers have a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail, win/loss or safe/unsafe and one or more independent variables which contain any real value.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use a dataset that contains multiple types of DDoS attacks - Netbios, Portmap and Syn - which take place over two different days. The dataset will be split into two sets **training** and **testing**. The training set will be used to train a logistic regression model to predict our testing set by classifying DDOS or BENIGN connections based on the independent variables. The dependent variable is a label of two values NETBIOS/PORTMAP (DDoS attacks) or BENIGN (Harmless connection) and the independent variables are real network data such as flow duration, packets sent per second, lengths of forward packets and more. <br/>\n",
    "In simple terms, our model will look at the the day 1 data and learn what network data is labelled as NETBIOS/PORTMAP or BENIGN and attempt to predict whether connections from day 2 are DDoS connections or benign connections without looking at their correct labels. The predicted labels are compared to actual labels to obtain a classification report containing accuracy and error rates.\n",
